# ORQ Project

This repo provides access to and information  on the ORQ project, a second MVP based on the bodtrac project. This was built using Laravel, HTMX and Alpine Js. Deployed on AWS. Actual code is on a private repo due to the project still being in the marking phase at my university.

## Project Overview

A prototype of a fitness web app that allows users to create and login to accounts to enable the creation of workout templates that users can use to generate workout logs. These workout logs can then be utilised to track and record workouts. These logs will also be used to create data visualisations focused on demonstrating progress within the sport known as powerlifting. It will calculate and visualise powerlifting-specific data. This web app will solve the problem of existing solutions being generic in nature and not focused on a particular sport.
